# Release Process

Versioning is using [MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver).
No changes in the code are needed to correctly version this package.

1. Update the version in the following files:
   - [`splunk-otel-dotnet-install.sh`](splunk-otel-dotnet-install.sh#L34)
   - [`Splunk.OTel.DotNet.psm1`](Splunk.OTel.DotNet.psm1#L244)

1. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with the new release.

1. Create a pull request on GitHub with the changes described in the changelog.
   - `*scripts*` and `validate-documentation` jobs will fail
     because the release is not published yet.

1. Once the pull request has been merged, create a signed tag for the merged commit.
   You can do this using the following Bash snippet:

   ```bash
   TAG='v{new-version-here}'
   COMMIT='{commit-sha-here}'
   git tag -s -m $TAG $TAG $COMMIT
   git push upstream $TAG
   ```

   After you've pushed the git tag, a `ci` GitHub workflow starts.
